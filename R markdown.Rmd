## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
# Usage example of read_shapefile()
library(geospatial)
shapefile_data <- read_shapefile("path/to/shapefile")
print(shapefile_data)
#This function reads a shapefile (.shp) and its associated files (.shx, .dbf, etc.) and returns a spatial object.

#This function calculates the distance between two points on the Earth's surface using the Haversine formula.
# Usage example of calculate_distance()
distance <- calculate_distance(40.7128, -74.0060, 34.0522, -118.2437)
print(distance)
#in km

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

# Usage example of plot_map()
library(geospatial)
shapefile_data <- read_shapefile("path/to/shapefile")
plot_map(spatial_data = shapefile_data, map_title = "My Map")
#i will need to use 'maptools' for manipulation

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#future improvements:
support for interactive maps.
conclusion
This package provides essential tools for working with spatial data in R, allowing for easier visualization to the human eye.
